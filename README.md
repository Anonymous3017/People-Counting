# People-Counting
Developed a Python script using OpenCV, Torch, and NumPy libraries to perform real-time people counting in a video stream. â€¢ Utilized a pre-trained YOLOv7 model for accurate object detection, enabling the script to draw bounding boxes around detected individuals and count the number of people.
